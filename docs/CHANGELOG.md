# change log

## Unreleased

### Features

- Add `mimo` (MiMo) as a supported agent, reading skills from `~/.config/mimocode/skills/` globally and `<project>/.mimocode/skills/` per project; supported-agent counts in both READMEs move from 48 to 49

### DX

- Bump `actions/checkout` to `v7`, `actions/setup-node` to `v7`, and `softprops/action-gh-release` to `v3` in both workflows, clearing the Node 20 runtime deprecation warning on every run

## v0.4.8 - 2026-09-13

`v0.4.8` adds WorkBuddy AI as a supported agent, finishes the move to `wehuman01/aweskill`, and teaches `doctor` the difference between a copy projection that drifted and a skill another tool owns.

### Features

- Add `workbuddy` (WorkBuddy AI) as a supported agent, reading skills from `~/.workbuddy-ai/skills/` globally and `<project>/.workbuddy-ai/skills/` per project; supported-agent counts in both READMEs move from 47 to 48
- Copy projections (the Windows fallback) now record a content-hash baseline, so `doctor` classifies them as linked, stale, locally-modified, or orphaned, and `doctor sync --apply` refreshes only proven-pristine copies instead of letting store updates silently never reach the agent
- `--force` now recreates an existing matching projection instead of skipping it, and warns when the replaced copy carried local edits
- Skills installed by another tool (foreign ownership markers such as `.ctx-skill.json`) are reported as external in `agent list` and `doctor sync`, excluded from import advice, and skipped by `store scan --import`

### Fixes

- Point built-in skill sources and self-update at `wehuman01/aweskill` (the repository moved from `wehuman01/aweskill`), and update the tests and the contributing guide's clone URL that still pinned the old location
- Disable the npm update check in the test environment; the two `main()`-based integration tests that intermittently timed out were waiting on that registry call

### DX

- Add `npm run verify` (lint → test → build, stops at the first failure) as the single pre-commit gate, documented in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Run CI on pushes to `dev` as well as `main`, so changes are checked before they reach a release

## v0.4.7 - 2026-09-10

### Refactor

- Migrate bundle definitions to per-skill source format (`skills: [{name, source}]`), replacing the legacy `sources` group list
- Accept the legacy format on reads (name list + `sources` groups merged in) and always emit the new format on writes
- Migrate all 15 bundle templates to the new format; five previously source-less templates now carry verified sources where confirmable
- Add `bundleSkillNames` and `groupSkillsBySource` helpers, and update commands (`bundle`, `enable`, `disable`, `list`, `update`), hygiene, and references to use the new shape
- Preserve install-time warnings for skills without a confirmable source (`source: null`)

## v0.4.6 - 2026-09-09

`v0.4.6` is a docs-alignment patch for the v0.4.5 release: the README version badges were still on 0.4.4, a leftover empty `## Unreleased` heading sat between the v0.4.5 and v0.4.4 entries, and the v0.4.3 overview still opened with "`Unreleased`" instead of the version number.

### Fixes

- Sync the version badges in `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` to the released version
- Move the empty `## Unreleased` heading back to the top of the changelog and fix the stale "`Unreleased`" wording in the v0.4.3 entry

## v0.4.5 - 2026-09-09

### Features
- Add `bundle template install` command to install skills from recorded source groups, with fallback to plain import for templates without sources
- Add verified source groups for nine bundle templates (awe, aweskill, baoyu-skills, caveman, nature-paper-skills, oh-my-skills-peng, rtk-skills, taste-skill, peng-crosspost-publishing)

## v0.4.4 - 2026-09-05

`v0.4.4` makes `update --check` dramatically faster and keeps the `aweskill` meta-skill from checking skills the user did not ask about. Checking for updates no longer needs to clone every tracked source: when the recorded remote tree SHA for a skill differs, aweskill reports an update (or local drift) straight from the upstream tree listing. Source repos are also checked in parallel instead of one at a time, and the resolved branch ref is cached in the lock so later checks skip the HEAD/main/master fallback.

### Update performance

`aweskill update --check <skill>` now resolves most outcomes from the GitHub trees API without cloning the source into a temp directory. When the tree SHA for a skill's subpath differs from the recorded value, it reports `Update available:` or `Skipped ...: local changes detected.` directly, and only a real `update` clones the source. Source groups are processed with a small bounded concurrency pool, with output still flushed in deterministic group order; lock metadata (including the newly persisted `resolvedRef`) is written serially after all groups finish to avoid a read-modify-write race on the lock file.

### Meta-skill scoping

- The `aweskill` meta-skill now instructs agents to pass named skills to `update --check` instead of running a full check over all tracked skills uninvited, plus `update [skill...]` for scoped refreshes.

### README reorganization

- Reworked both READMEs and `README.ai.md`: moved the "Powered by aweskill" listing into a dedicated getting-started flow and refreshed install/usage guidance.

### Highlights

- `update --check` avoids cloning sources when the remote tree SHA changes (the largest single speedup)
- Parallelize source groups with bounded concurrency, keeping deterministic output order
- Persist `resolvedRef` in the skill lock to skip HEAD/main iteration on later checks
- Scope meta-skill update instructions to the named skills; agents no longer check the whole store uninvited
- Refresh READMEs and sync the version badge to 0.4.4

## v0.4.3 - 2026-09-04

`v0.4.3` adds skill authoring support. Creating a skill now has the same first-class lifecycle as installing one: `store create` scaffolds a valid skill into the central store (or a repo directory with `--dir`), and a third built-in meta-skill, `aweskill-creator`, teaches agents the full authoring loop — capture intent, check for existing skills, scaffold, draft, test, validate, and project.

### Skill authoring

New `aweskill store create <name> [--description <description>] [--dir <dir>]` command scaffolds a skill directory with valid `SKILL.md` frontmatter and `references/`. Names are sanitized then validated as strict kebab-case (1-64 characters) and fail fast on conflicts; missing `--description` writes a TODO placeholder with a warning. Created skills are not source-tracked, matching `scan --import` semantics.

### Highlights

- Add `aweskill store create <name>` for skill scaffolding in the central store or under `--dir`
- Add built-in `aweskill-creator` meta-skill; `store init` installs it and the `aweskill` bundle template includes it
- Route authoring intents in the `aweskill` meta-skill to `$aweskill-creator`
- Update both READMEs and README.ai.md to cover the third built-in skill

## v0.4.2

`v0.4.2` adds Codex shared-root awareness and config-based skill toggling. `aweskill` now recognizes that Codex reads skills from both `~/.codex/skills` and the shared `~/.agents/skills` (plus repo-level `.agents/skills`), and it can hide a skill from Codex without removing projections or affecting other agents by writing a `[[skills.config]]` toggle into `~/.codex/config.toml`.

### Codex skill toggle

New `agent disable skill` and `agent enable skill` commands manage per-skill `enabled = false` entries under `[[skills.config]]` in the Codex user config. Codex only reads skill toggles from the user config layer, so these commands always operate at user scope; project-layer toggles are ignored by Codex.

`agent list --agent codex` now reports shared `.agents/skills` entries in a read-only `shared` section, annotating duplicates and entries hidden by config toggles. `agent add` and `agent remove` continue to touch only `~/.codex/skills`, and they print a note when a skill also exists in a shared root. `doctor sync --apply` never mutates shared entries.

### Documentation

- Added `awerouter` to the "Powered by aweskill" section in both READMEs.
- Updated `docs/article_media/0808/translation.md`.

### Highlights

- Add `agent disable skill` and `agent enable skill` for Codex `[[skills.config]]` toggles
- `agent list --agent codex` shows shared `.agents/skills` entries with duplicate/hidden annotations
- `doctor sync --apply` skips shared entries; add/remove warn when a skill also lives in a shared root
- Add `awerouter` to the "Powered by aweskill" section
- Update 0808 translation article

## v0.4.1

`v0.4.1` is a maintenance release. Since `v0.4.0`, the release workflow is hardened with npm provenance, a fail-fast version check, and publish-before-release ordering, while both READMEs gained a Support section with Ko-fi and WeChat Pay sponsorship options and new article media were added under `docs/article_media/`.

### Hardened release workflow

The tag-triggered release workflow now verifies the tag against `package.json` before spending time on build and test, publishes to npm with provenance attestation, and creates the GitHub Release only after a successful publish — a failed publish never leaves a release without a package.

### Support section and FUNDING

A Ko-fi badge and a "Support the project" section (Ko-fi + WeChat Pay) were added to both READMEs, backed by `.github/FUNDING.yml` and a WeChat Pay QR image under `assets/images/`.

### Article media

Added release articles and translations under `docs/article_media/`: the 0804 scan-update-symlinks article and translation, the 0806 "use-aweskill-wear-the-badge" article and translation, and the 0808 Windows announcement translation. `aweswitch` was added to the "Powered by aweskill" section.

### Highlights

- Fail-fast tag/version verification in the release workflow
- npm publish with provenance attestation; publish runs before GitHub Release creation
- Add Ko-fi badge, Support section (Ko-fi + WeChat Pay), and `.github/FUNDING.yml`
- Add 0804/0806/0808 article media and translations
- Add aweswitch to the "Powered by aweskill" section

## v0.4.0

`v0.4.0` improves Windows support across npm spawning, archive extraction, and path handling. Windows users can now run `aweskill agent add` end-to-end without Unix-specific assumptions.

### Windows npm spawn

Agent installs that depend on npm now spawn npm in a shell on Windows, so `npx` and npm-installed CLIs resolve correctly through PATHEXT. The prior implementation called npm directly, which failed when the agent binary was a `.cmd` wrapper.

### Sciskill archive extraction on Windows

Sciskill archives are now extracted with cross-platform archive handling, fixing extraction failures on Windows where `tar` flags and path separators differ from Unix.

### CRLF frontmatter parsing

Skill-doc frontmatter is now normalized before parsing, so skills installed from Windows-checkout repos with CRLF line endings no longer produce blank frontmatter fields.

### Path normalization in tests

Symlink and readlink assertions now normalize trailing separators, preventing spurious test failures on Windows where `fs.realpath` and `readlink` return paths with a trailing backslash.

### Cross-platform documentation

Both READMEs now state cross-platform support inline rather than in a dedicated Windows chapter. The zh-CN README has been synced to match the English wording.

### Highlights

- Spawn npm in a shell on Windows so `.cmd` agent wrappers resolve
- Cross-platform sciskill archive extraction
- Normalize CRLF frontmatter before skill-doc parsing
- Normalize readlink trailing separators in symlink tests
- State cross-platform support inline in both READMEs

## v0.3.8

`v0.3.8` fixes dangling projection symlinks inside nested git worktrees and adds an opt-in for depth-independent targets. Since `v0.3.7`, a projection committed to git and checked out at a different directory depth — most commonly a nested git worktree — no longer breaks when absolute targets are enabled.

### Absolute projection symlinks

`aweskill` writes **relative** symlink targets by default, which only resolve at the depth they were created for. A projection committed to git and checked out into a deeper worktree would dangle. You can now opt in to **absolute** targets that resolve at any depth, either per command with `aweskill agent add … --absolute`, or globally with `AWESKILL_ABSOLUTE_SYMLINKS=1` (the flag overrides the env var). The default stays relative; absolute targets hard-code this machine's `~/.aweskill` path, so use them only when the same checkout is reused at varying depths on one machine.

### Highlights

- Add opt-in absolute projection symlink targets for nested git worktrees (closes #12)
- Add `aweskill agent add --absolute` flag; keep `AWESKILL_ABSOLUTE_SYMLINKS=1` as the global default
- Document the relative-vs-absolute portability tradeoff in README, README.zh-CN, and DESIGN

## v0.3.7

`v0.3.7` adds a post-command update reminder and cleans up the README install section. Since `v0.3.6`, the CLI now checks npm for a newer version once every 24 hours and shows a non-blocking reminder after the command finishes. The "pin a specific release" section has been removed from both READMEs to avoid users installing stale versions.

### Update reminder

After any regular command, `aweskill` checks whether a newer version is available on npm (at most once every 24 hours). If an update exists, a warning line is printed after the command output. The check runs in parallel with the command so it does not add latency. Set `AWESKILL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable.

### Highlights

- Add post-command update-available reminder with 24h throttle
- Remove pinned version install section from README and README.zh-CN
- Update version badge to 0.3.7

## v0.3.6

`v0.3.6` is a docs and polish release. Since `v0.3.5`, the README has been refreshed with a "Powered by aweskill" section, badge graphics, and org links. A minor test cleanup removes trailing blank lines. No functional changes to the CLI.

### Highlights

- Add "Powered by aweskill" section with AI tools and project collaborations
- Add aweskill badge to README titles
- Add Webioinfo org link to README
- Fix: remove trailing blank lines in test file
- Update scan import behavior in DESIGN.md

## v0.3.5

`v0.3.5` removes the standalone `store import` command and consolidates skill importing into `store scan --import`, providing a single unified workflow for discovering and importing skills from agent directories. Since `v0.3.4`, the `import` command and its source-tracking options (`--link-source`, `--track-source`) have been removed, the `scan` command options have been simplified, and all documentation and tests have been updated to reflect the new workflow.

### Unified scan --import workflow

The standalone `store import` command has been removed. Use `store scan --import` instead, which discovers skills from agent directories and imports them in a single step. This eliminates the confusion between `import` and `install` by giving each command a clear, distinct purpose: `scan --import` for batch discovery, `install` for individual tracked installs.

### Simplified scan options

Removed `--link-source` and `--track-source` flags from the scan command. The `--keep-source` flag now clearly means "keep original files in place instead of replacing with symlinks." Option descriptions have been tightened for clarity.

### Highlights

- Removed standalone `store import` command
- Consolidated import functionality into `store scan --import`
- Removed `--link-source` and `--track-source` options
- Simplified `--keep-source` and `--override` option descriptions
- Updated all documentation to reference `scan --import` workflow
- Updated tests to use new command paths

## v0.3.4

`v0.3.4` adds bundle-aware update, improves CLI help clarity, and introduces new update options for managing tracked skills. Since `v0.3.3`, the `update` command supports `--bundle` to update all skills in a bundle at once, `bundle list` and `bundle template list` now default to name-only output with `--verbose` for full details, and a new `bundle template show` command displays template contents. The `update` command also gains `--prune` to remove tracking for missing skills and `--verbose` for detailed source diagnostics.

### Bundle-aware update

Added `--bundle <name>` flag to `aweskill update` so users can update all skills in a bundle with one command. The bundle is validated against the central store before processing.

### Simplified bundle list output

`bundle list` and `bundle template list` now show only bundle names by default, with a hint to use `--verbose` for full skill details. This makes the default output easier to parse in scripts.

### New update options

Added `--prune` to remove tracking entries for skills missing from the local central store, and `--verbose` to show detailed source diagnostics for source-missing skills. Removed the redundant `--dry-run` flag (use `--check` instead).

### Import vs install clarity

Updated command descriptions and added FAQ entries in both English and Chinese READMEs to clearly explain the difference between `store import` (local files, no source tracking by default) and `store install` (GitHub/sciskill, source tracking enabled by default).

### Highlights

- Added `--bundle` flag to `aweskill update`
- Simplified `bundle list` and `bundle template list` default output to names only
- Added `bundle template show` command
- Added `--prune` and `--verbose` options to `update`
- Removed redundant `--dry-run` flag
- Clarified import vs install difference in CLI help and FAQ
- Updated droma-metaai template with correct skill names

## v0.3.3

`v0.3.3` hardens the core lock and type infrastructure, adds competitive research, and revises the project's engineering guidelines. Since `v0.3.2`, lock file writes are now atomic, a TypeScript typecheck step guards CI, the scanner filters out `.system` directories, and path safety helpers are centralized. The engineering principles have been renamed to "Engineering Taste" and expanded. The README comparison table was reorganized and competitive research on SkillClaw, SkillNexus, and Vibe-Skills was added.

### Atomic lock writes and type safety

Lock file writes now go through a temp-file-then-rename path to prevent corruption from interrupted writes. A `typecheck` npm script and CI step were added. The `isPathSafe` helper replaces scattered path validation logic across the codebase.

### Engineering Taste

The "Code Style" section in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` was renamed to "Engineering Taste" and expanded to cover simplicity, clarity, decoupling, honesty, focus, durability, and first-principles thinking.

### Competitive research and README updates

Added research documents on SkillClaw, SkillNexus, and Vibe-Skills under `docs/todo/`. The README comparison table was reorganized — the cc-switch column was removed and related projects were split into "Similar Skill Managers" and "Other Useful AI Tools". Both `aweskill` and `aweskill-doctor` SKILL.md files were significantly revised for clearer workflows and routing.

### Highlights

- Atomic lock file writes via temp-file-then-rename
- Added TypeScript typecheck to CI (`npm run typecheck`)
- Centralized path safety with `isPathSafe`
- Scanner excludes `.system` skill directories
- Renamed and expanded engineering principles to "Engineering Taste"
- Reorganized README comparison table and related projects
- Added competitive research on SkillClaw, SkillNexus, Vibe-Skills
- Revised `aweskill` and `aweskill-doctor` SKILL.md documentation

## v0.3.2

`v0.3.2` expands the agent-operated aweskill story and adds reusable bundle templates. Since `v0.3.1`, the project documentation now includes agent-assisted install media, two bilingual long-form articles, improved README language switching and Chinese copy, plus new bundled Skill sets for publishing workflows.

### Agent-assisted install and article media

Added article media under `docs/article_media/0504/` and `docs/article_media/0505/`, including the agent-assisted install screenshot and bilingual Markdown articles. The first article explains the multi-agent Skill sharing problem that aweskill solves; the second focuses on letting AI coding agents operate aweskill through `README.ai.md`, `aweskill`, and `aweskill-doctor`.

### README and AI bootstrap copy

Both READMEs were refreshed around the current product positioning, with clearer language links, improved Chinese wording, website references, the agent-assisted install screenshot, and updated specific-release install snippets. `README.ai.md` was tightened so the bootstrap protocol stays focused on installing aweskill for the current agent rather than broad projection.

### Bundle templates and built-in skill guidance

Added reusable bundle templates for Baoyu publishing workflows in `resources/bundle_templates/`, and updated the built-in `aweskill` Skill guidance to reflect the current install and projection model.

### Highlights

- Added bilingual article media for the aweskill multi-agent sharing and agent-operated workflows.
- Added the agent-assisted install screenshot used by README and article content.
- Refined README language links, Chinese wording, website references, and pinned install examples.
- Added Baoyu publishing bundle templates.
- Updated built-in `aweskill` Skill guidance for current bootstrap and projection behavior.

## v0.3.1

`v0.3.1` adds the official website for aweskill. Since `v0.3.0`, the project now has a public site at [aweskill.wehuman.top](https://aweskill.wehuman.top) with install guides, agent compatibility overview, and bilingual support (English and Chinese). The website also includes the contribution guidelines in `aweskill-web/docs/contribution.md`.

### Official website

The [aweskill-web](https://github.com/wehuman01/aweskill/tree/main/aweskill-web) project was added as the official website for the CLI tool. It is built with Astro and Tailwind CSS, supporting both English and Chinese content. The site badge was added to both `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md`.

### `aweskill self-update`

Added `aweskill self-update` command to update the CLI tool itself. Supports two update sources:

- `aweskill self-update` — update from npm registry (stable)
- `aweskill self-update --dev` — update from GitHub dev branch (build from source)
- `aweskill self-update --check` — check for updates without installing

The npm mode fetches the latest version from the registry and runs `npm install -g aweskill`. The dev mode clones the `dev` branch, builds from source, and installs globally. Both modes prompt for confirmation before proceeding.

### Highlights

- Added official website at [aweskill.wehuman.top](https://aweskill.wehuman.top)
- Website built with Astro + Tailwind CSS, bilingual support
- Added `aweskill self-update` command with `--dev` and `--check` flags
- npm stable and GitHub dev branch update sources
- Confirmation prompt before applying updates

## v0.3.0

`v0.3.0` improves the first-time setup experience and makes built-in skills updatable. Since `v0.2.9`, `aweskill store init` now tracks built-in skills with a GitHub source record so they can be refreshed with `aweskill update`. The project also added AI-facing documentation for self-bootstrap installation.

### Built-in skill source tracking

When `aweskill store init` copies the bundled `aweskill` and `aweskill-doctor` skills into the central store, it now writes a lock entry with `source: wehuman01/aweskill`, `sourceType: github`, and the computed directory hash. This means after a fresh install, running `aweskill update` can pull the latest versions of these skills from GitHub — previously they were unmanaged copies with no source record.

### AI-facing documentation

A new `README.ai.md` provides a step-by-step bootstrap protocol for AI coding agents to self-install aweskill. The main README's "Ask an AI agent" section now points to this file instead of listing commands inline, giving agents a single authoritative reference.

The built-in `aweskill` SKILL.md gained a "First-Time Setup" section with a complete bootstrap sequence (install → init → project → verify → restart), with fallback entry points for partial installations.

### Highlights

- `aweskill store init` writes lock entries for built-in skills with GitHub source metadata
- Built-in skills are now refreshable via `aweskill update` after initial install
- Added `README.ai.md` — AI-agent-facing bootstrap protocol
- SKILL.md "First-Time Setup" section with complete bootstrap sequence
- Simplified "Ask an AI agent" sections in README.md and README.zh-CN.md

## v0.2.9

`v0.2.9` focuses on engineering infrastructure. Since `v0.2.8`, the project added GitHub Actions CI, introduced Biome for linting and formatting, split the monolithic `index.ts` into focused modules, derived the `AgentId` type from the agent registry to eliminate manual synchronization, and added an automated release workflow for tag-triggered npm publishing and GitHub Release creation.

### AgentId single source of truth

The `AgentId` type was previously a manually maintained 46-member string union in `src/types.ts` that required updating in four separate files whenever a new agent was added. It is now derived directly from the `AGENTS` registry keys in `src/lib/agents.ts` via `export type AgentId = keyof typeof AGENTS`. This also fixed a latent type error where `zencoder` was registered in the agent registry but missing from the union type. Adding a new agent now only requires editing `src/lib/agents.ts`.

### `index.ts` split into CLI modules

The 753-line `src/index.ts` entry point was split into four files:

- `src/cli/errors.ts` — error message formatting
- `src/cli/helpers.ts` — runtime context, CLI utilities, and guards
- `src/cli/commands.ts` — command tree registration and reusable command builders
- `src/index.ts` — thin entry shell (~40 lines) that re-exports `createProgram` and `main`

The public API (`createProgram`, `main`) remains available from the same import path.

### Biome lint toolchain

The project now uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. New npm scripts: `lint`, `lint:fix`, and `format`. The CI pipeline runs `npm run lint` before tests. All existing lint issues were fixed: unused imports, implicit `any` type annotations, string concatenation to template literals, and import ordering.

### GitHub Actions CI and release automation

Two GitHub Actions workflows were added:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs lint and tests on every push to `main`/`dev` and on PRs targeting `main`, across 3 operating systems and 2 Node versions.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — triggered by `v*` tags; runs tests, builds the CLI, creates a GitHub Release from the changelog, and publishes to npm.

### Highlights

- Derived `AgentId` from the `AGENTS` registry, fixing the missing `zencoder` type and eliminating 4-file synchronization for new agents.
- Split `src/index.ts` (753 lines) into `src/cli/errors.ts`, `src/cli/helpers.ts`, and `src/cli/commands.ts`.
- Added Biome lint toolchain with `lint`, `lint:fix`, and `format` scripts.
- Added GitHub Actions CI (lint + test matrix across Ubuntu/macOS/Windows, Node 20/22).
- Added GitHub Actions release workflow for tag-triggered npm publish and GitHub Release creation.
- Fixed all existing lint issues: unused imports, implicit `any`, template literals, import ordering.

## v0.2.8

`v0.2.8` expands the store inspection and hygiene workflow around three areas: local central-store discovery, direct skill inspection, and `SKILL.md` frontmatter repair. Since `v0.2.7`, `find` can now search the local `~/.aweskill/skills/` repository through a `local` provider, `store show` can print a summary, the raw `SKILL.md`, or just the file path for one managed skill, and `doctor fix-skills` can inspect or normalize malformed frontmatter with both actionable and informational categories.

### Local search provider and `store show`

`aweskill find <query> --local` and `aweskill store find <query> --local` now search the local central store instead of the remote registries. The same behavior is also available through `--provider local`. Local results are ranked by matches in the skill name, description, and body text from `SKILL.md`, and they print the skill path plus an `aweskill store show <skill>` hint instead of a remote install command.

`aweskill store show <skill>` is a new inspection command for managed local skills. It prints a short summary by default, supports `--raw` to print the full `SKILL.md`, and supports `--path` to print only the resolved `SKILL.md` path. Both READMEs now document the new search mode and inspection workflow.

### `doctor fix-skills` and frontmatter normalization

`aweskill doctor fix-skills` is a new dry-run-by-default hygiene command for malformed `SKILL.md` frontmatter. It can report and optionally rewrite missing closing delimiters, invalid YAML, missing frontmatter blocks, unusable names, and unusable descriptions. With `--include-info`, it also reports non-rewritten informational categories such as normalizable permissions, preserved unknown fields, and removable empty fields. With `--backup`, it copies original files into `~/.aweskill/backup/fix_skills/` before rewriting. The new `docs/fix-skills-categories.md` document explains each category with before/after examples.

### `find` filter validation tightened

`aweskill find` now validates `--domain` and `--stage` before sending a sciskill request. Invalid enum values fail fast and list the allowed values. The `skills-sh` provider also rejects `--domain` and `--stage` directly instead of silently falling back to partial remote results.

### Highlights

- Added a `local` search provider for `aweskill find` / `aweskill store find`, plus the `--local` shortcut.
- Added `aweskill store show <skill>` with summary, raw, and path output modes.
- Added `aweskill doctor fix-skills` with actionable fixes, optional informational checks, and pre-rewrite backups.
- Added `docs/fix-skills-categories.md` with per-category behavior and before/after examples.
- Tightened `find` validation so invalid sciskill filters and `skills-sh`-only misuse fail fast.
- Updated `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` to document local central-store search and direct skill inspection.

## v0.2.7

`v0.2.7` is the release where `aweskill` fully repositions itself as a CLI-first skill package manager. Since `v0.2.6`, the CLI renamed `store download` to `store install`, refreshed its top-level aliases and help text around the install/update lifecycle, reworked both READMEs into a FAQ-first and comparison-driven format, and rewrote the built-in `aweskill` meta-skill around task-routing workflow sections. The underlying install and update semantics stay the same, but the command surface, documentation, and built-in agent guidance are more explicit and more consistent.

### `store download` is now `store install`

`aweskill store download` was renamed to `aweskill store install`. The top-level alias `aweskill download` was renamed to `aweskill install` as part of the same cleanup. The CLI help text, README examples, and related tests were updated to use the install-oriented naming consistently, while the actual source resolution and tracked update behavior remained unchanged.

### README restructured with FAQ and comparison table

Both `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` were restructured around a more product-level overview:

- The old "Why aweskill" and "Find -> Download -> Update" sections were replaced with an FAQ section covering who aweskill is for, where skills are stored, supported agent types, the local-first model, built-in agent-callable skills, and the find/install/update lifecycle.
- A new comparison table was added to position `aweskill` against `cc-switch`, `sciskill`, `skillfish`, and `skills` across several capability dimensions.
- The project headline and tagline were updated to frame aweskill as a CLI-first skill package manager for AI agents.

### Built-in `aweskill` meta-skill restructured around task routing

The built-in `aweskill` skill under `resources/skills/aweskill/` was rewritten from a flat command reference into a task-router model:

- A new Task Router section classifies requests into Store Work, Source Lifecycle, Bundle Work, and Projection Work.
- Workflow guidance now follows those task domains and emphasizes inspection before mutation.
- Source Lifecycle became a first-class section covering `find`, `install`, and `update` with an explicit decision order.
- The references under `command-map.md` and `common-flows.md` were reorganized to match the same task-domain structure.

### Supporting documentation and package metadata refresh

`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, and `package.json` were refreshed to match the new CLI-first positioning and updated command names. The version badges and install snippets in both READMEs were also bumped for the `0.2.7` release.

### Highlights

- Renamed `store download` → `store install` and `aweskill download` → `aweskill install`.
- Updated CLI help text, implementation, and tests to use the new install terminology consistently.
- Reworked both READMEs into FAQ-first docs with a new comparison table and refreshed positioning.
- Restructured the built-in `aweskill` meta-skill around a four-domain task router.
- Reorganized built-in reference docs to match the new task-domain workflow model.
- Refreshed related docs and package metadata for the `0.2.7` release.

## v0.2.6

`v0.2.6` tightens a few core behaviors without changing the overall command model. Since `v0.2.5`, mutating agent commands now default to the detected installed agent set instead of silently falling back to every supported agent, central-store symlink ownership checks now use real path-boundary logic instead of string-prefix matching, and store backups now carry a lightweight manifest for future format evolution while staying compatible with older archives.

### Safer default target selection for mutating agent commands

`agent add`, `agent remove`, `agent recover`, and `doctor relink` now treat omitted `--agent` as "use the installed agents detected in this scope" and fail fast when none are found. Users who really want to target every supported agent for a scope must now say so explicitly with `--agent all`. This keeps the default path smaller and more predictable, and avoids creating projection directories for agents that are not actually installed.

### More honest managed-symlink detection

Symlink ownership checks now use path-boundary containment rules instead of `startsWith` string matching. A symlink into a sibling path such as `~/.aweskill/skills2/...` is no longer misclassified as an aweskill-managed projection for `~/.aweskill/skills/...`. This makes projection inspection and cleanup match the real filesystem model more closely.

### Backup manifest for forward-compatible archives

`store backup` now writes a `backup.json` manifest into the archive root. The manifest records the backup format, version, creation time, and whether bundles were included. `store restore` reads the manifest when present, but still accepts older manifest-free archives and unpacked backup directories. This adds a migration hook for future backup-format changes without breaking existing backups.

### CLI UI cleanup

The CLI message formatter was refactored into smaller rule groups and helper functions. Output behavior stays the same, but the dispatch logic is now easier to read and extend.

### Highlights

- Changed mutating agent commands to default to detected installed agents only; `--agent all` is now the explicit full-scope path.
- Fixed managed-symlink classification to use real path boundaries instead of string prefixes.
- Added `backup.json` manifest metadata to new backup archives.
- Kept restore compatibility with older archives and unpacked backup directories that do not contain a manifest.
- Refactored CLI message formatting logic in `src/lib/ui.ts`.

## v0.2.5

`v0.2.5` is the release where `aweskill` gains a skill search command, support for the sciskill registry, and smarter update checks that skip unchanged GitHub sources. Since `v0.2.4`, the CLI added `store find` to search across skills.sh and sciskill in one query, taught `store install` to pull skills directly from sciskill, made `store update` compare remote tree SHAs to avoid unnecessary clones, and added top-level aliases for the three most-used store commands.

### Skill search with `store find`

`aweskill store find <query>` searches both skills.sh and the sciskill registry, merges results by name, and prints either a directly downloadable source or a discover-only result with a details URL. Results are numbered and indented, and a configurable timeout keeps the search responsive. The `--provider`, `--limit`, `--domain`, and `--stage` flags let users narrow the search scope.

### Sciskill registry support

`store install` now accepts `sciskill:<skill-id>` as a source type. The CLI downloads and extracts the archive from the sciskill API, wraps flat archives that place `SKILL.md` at the root into a properly named subdirectory, and records the skill in the lock file for future updates. Source parsing and lock entries were extended to represent the new source type.

### Faster updates with remote tree SHA comparison

`store update` now fetches the GitHub repository tree for tracked GitHub sources and compares the remote tree SHA against the locked SHA before cloning. Skills whose remote SHA matches the locked SHA are skipped entirely, reducing unnecessary network traffic and clone time. The tree SHA is recorded during download and update, and a new `fetchGitHubRepoTree` utility handles the API interaction.

### Top-level store aliases

`aweskill import`, `aweskill install`, and `aweskill update` are now available as top-level aliases for their `store` equivalents, making the most common operations shorter to type.

### Duplicate-skill conflict reporting

When a download or update encounters a duplicate skill name, the conflict message now includes the source path, source URL, ref, and the command name, making it easier to understand and resolve the collision without re-running anything.

### Highlights

- Added `aweskill store find <query>` with skills.sh and sciskill provider support, merged results, and numbered output.
- Added `sciskill:<skill-id>` source type for `store install` with flat-archive wrapping.
- Added `fetchGitHubRepoTree` and remote tree SHA comparison in `store update` to skip unchanged sources.
- Added `aweskill import`, `aweskill install`, `aweskill update` top-level aliases.
- Improved duplicate-skill conflict messages with source context.
- Added `droma-metaai` bundle template.
- Updated README, README.zh-CN, and docs/CONTRIBUTING.md with find/install/update docs and streamlined layout.

## v0.2.4

`v0.2.4` is the release where `aweskill` grows from a central-store projector into a source-aware skill manager. Since `v0.2.3`, the CLI learned how to download skills from local paths or GitHub sources, track them in `skills-lock.json`, refresh them with `store update`, install built-in skills during `store init`, and let explicit local imports opt into that same tracked update flow. The central store remains the protected local state, while upstream sources become comparison points for later updates.

### Download and update mode

`store install` and `store update` are now first-class central-store workflows. Users can install one or more skills from a local path or GitHub repository, optionally rename single-skill installs, and later ask `store update` to check or refresh tracked skills from their recorded source. This release also adds the underlying machinery for source parsing, temporary clone resolution, downloadable skill discovery, deterministic directory hashing, conflict classification, and source-batched update checks.

### Skill lock and tracked local imports

The new `skills-lock.json` file records tracked source metadata alongside the current central-store hash for each managed skill. `store import` now accepts `--track-source` for explicit local paths, which lets a copied local skill join future `store update` runs without changing the default import behavior. The tracked entry still treats `~/.aweskill/skills/<name>/` as the installed copy, so edits inside the central store continue to block updates unless the user explicitly overrides them.

### Link-compatible tracked imports and lock cleanup

Tracked imports can now be combined with `--link-source`. This lets a user import a local skill, replace the original path with an aweskill-managed projection, and still keep the upstream local source relationship needed for later comparisons. Scan-based imports remain untracked for now; only explicit local import paths can opt in.

`store remove` now removes the corresponding `skills-lock.json` entry when a tracked skill is deleted from the central store. This closes the lifecycle loop for tracked local skills and prevents `store update` from continuing to report a removed skill as reinstallable from source.

### Built-in skill installation during init

`store init` now installs the built-in `aweskill` and `aweskill-doctor` meta-skills into the central store without overwriting an existing user-managed copy. This makes a fresh aweskill home immediately usable for agent-side projection workflows while preserving local customizations if those built-ins were already imported.

### Highlights

- Added `aweskill store install` and `aweskill store update` plus `skills-lock.json` tracking.
- Added source parsing, clone/discovery helpers, deterministic hashing, and update batching by source.
- Added `aweskill store import <path> --track-source` for explicit local import tracking.
- Kept tracked update state anchored to the central store copy instead of the external source directory.
- Allowed `--track-source` and `--link-source` to work together for explicit local imports.
- Made `aweskill store remove` clean the tracked lock entry for removed skills.
- Made `aweskill store init` install built-in meta-skills into the central store.

## v0.2.3

`v0.2.3` is the release where `aweskill` simplifies its built-in meta-skill set and makes multi-target bundle and agent operations easier to use. Since `v0.2.2`, the repository dropped the separate `aweskill-advanced` skill, folded its non-diagnostic guidance into `aweskill`, expanded bundle templates, and let several CLI commands accept space-separated target names in addition to comma-separated lists.

### Built-in skill consolidation

The standalone `aweskill-advanced` skill was removed. Its projection-planning, bundle-template, recover, and migration guidance now lives in the main `aweskill` skill, while `aweskill-doctor` stays focused on repair-first flows. The READMEs, contributing guide, built-in bundle template, and skill descriptions were updated to match the new two-skill model.

### Easier multi-target CLI commands

`bundle add`, `bundle remove`, `agent add`, and `agent remove` now accept space-separated names as well as comma-separated input. Internally, the CLI now normalizes mixed name lists consistently, and `agent remove` reports missing skills or bundles without aborting the whole operation when valid targets are present.

### Template and layout updates

The built-in meta-skills tree now lives under `resources/skills/`, the Nature Paper bundle template was expanded and normalized, and the aweskill bundle template now tracks the two-skill built-in set. Update local built-in imports to `aweskill store import resources/skills/<name>` where needed.

### Highlights

- Removed the standalone `aweskill-advanced` built-in skill and folded its non-diagnostic guidance into `aweskill`.
- Updated `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, and `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` to document the two-skill built-in model.
- Added space-separated target support for `bundle add`, `bundle remove`, `agent add`, and `agent remove`.
- Added clearer `agent remove` handling for mixed valid and missing targets.
- Expanded and normalized the `Nature-Paper-Skills` bundle template.
- Updated the built-in skill bundle template and repository layout notes under `resources/skills/`.

## v0.2.2

`v0.2.2` fixes the command reference table order in both READMEs. Since `v0.2.1`, `doctor sync` was listed before `agent recover` in the table, which placed it out of the intended alphabetical grouping. The row order has been corrected so `agent recover` appears before `doctor sync`.

### Highlights

- Fixed command reference table row order in `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md`.

## v0.2.1

`v0.2.1` is the release where `aweskill` gets its own built-in meta-skills and a cleaner documentation split. Since `v0.2.0`, the CLI renamed its top-level command group from `skill` to `store`, unified agent-side inspection and repair under `doctor sync`, and added built-in meta-skills that teach AI coding agents how to operate the CLI directly.

### Built-in meta-skills

Two meta-skills now live under `skills/` in the repository: `aweskill` (day-to-day operations plus non-diagnostic projection strategy) and `aweskill-doctor` (diagnostics and repair). Each skill contains a `SKILL.md` with triggers and rules, a `references/` directory with flow examples and decision trees, and an `agents/openai.yaml` for Codex-compatible runtimes. Users can import them with `aweskill store import skills/<name>` and project them to any supported agent.

### Command surface rename

The old top-level `skill` command group was replaced with a unified `store` group (`store init`, `store where`, `store scan`, `store import`, `store list`, `store remove`). All existing behavior is preserved under the new names.

### Read-only inspection and sync-based repair

`agent list` is now a pure inspection command that classifies entries as `linked`, `broken`, `duplicate`, `matched`, `new`, or `suspicious` without mutating anything. All repair logic moved to `doctor sync`, which is dry-run by default and requires `--apply` to make changes. `doctor sync` also gained `--global`/`--project` scope and `--agent` filters, matching the same filter model used by `store scan` and `store import --scan`.

### Clearer documentation split

Complex developer-facing details (backup/restore behavior semantics, hygiene check integration, doctor dry-run mechanics) moved from the README to `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`. The built-in skill structure and design principles are also documented there. Both English and Chinese READMEs were updated in parallel.

### Highlights

- Added built-in meta-skills: `aweskill`, `aweskill-doctor`.
- Renamed `skill` top-level commands to `store` (`store init`, `store where`, `store scan`, `store import`, `store list`, `store remove`).
- Made `agent list` read-only; all repair now goes through `doctor sync`.
- Added scope and agent filters to `store scan`, `store import --scan`, and `doctor sync`.
- Added `broken` category for stale managed projections.
- Unified agent detection in `agent list` and `doctor sync`: both now auto-detect installed agents by scope instead of scanning all supported agents blindly.
- `agent supported` now shows `✓`/`x` install status per agent and lists detected global skills paths.
- `agent list` and `doctor sync` print the detected agent set before grouped results when `--agent` is omitted.
- `agent list` now reuses `doctor sync` dry-run logic directly, so stale managed projections and other dry-run classifications stay consistent.
- Added empty-result guard with actionable message when no agents are detected for the target scope.
- Moved developer documentation from README to `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Updated `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` with built-in skill section and trimmed doctor details.

## v0.2.0

`v0.2.0` is the release where `aweskill` turns its agent-side maintenance path into a more unified repair flow. Since `v0.1.9`, the CLI gained `doctor sync`, tightened duplicate classification, and made projection and cleanup behavior more consistent across the agent commands that inspect or repair local skill directories.

### `doctor sync` as the main repair entrypoint

`doctor sync` now bundles the logic for finding and repairing agent-side issues into one command path. It is designed to inspect local agent skill directories, classify the problems it finds, and apply safe repairs where the CLI can do so deterministically.

### More precise duplicate detection

Duplicate handling now distinguishes canonical duplicates, rule-matched duplicates, and safer projections more carefully. The matching flow also uses alphanumeric-only keys for duplicate comparison, which makes the classification less sensitive to formatting noise in path names.

### Highlights

- Added unified `aweskill doctor sync` for finding and repairing agent issues.
- Improved duplicate classification and display for canonical and rule-matched duplicates.
- Tightened duplicate matching with alphanumeric-only comparison keys.
- Made projection and cleanup behavior more consistent across the agent command set.

## v0.1.9

`v0.1.9` is the release where `aweskill` gets stricter about agent-side hygiene and adds a direct repair path for duplicate agent entries. Since `v0.1.8`, the CLI learned to classify suspicious agent skills before trying to import or relink them, and it now exposes a dedicated `doctor relink` command to turn duplicate agent directories back into managed projections.

### Suspicious agent entries handled explicitly

Agent-side checks now treat missing `SKILL.md` files and reserved names such as `.system` as `suspicious` instead of mixing them into normal duplicate or new-skill flows. That classification is shared across the core checking logic, `agent list`, and `agent list --update`, so the CLI skips unsafe entries consistently and emits clearer warnings about why they were ignored.

### Dedicated repair for duplicate agent directories

`aweskill doctor relink` now finds duplicate skill directories that already exist in the central store and can replace them with managed symlinks when run with `--apply`. The new command is deliberately narrow: it only acts on `duplicate` entries, leaves suspicious directories untouched, and gives users a dry-run view before making changes.

### Highlights

- Added `aweskill doctor relink [--apply] [--global|--project [dir]] [--agent <agent>]`.
- Added `suspicious` as an explicit agent-skill category for reserved names and entries missing `SKILL.md`.
- Updated `agent list --update` to skip suspicious entries with clearer warnings.
- Documented the new import defaults and agent-side hygiene rules in the README and contributing guide.

## v0.1.8

`v0.1.8` is the release where `aweskill` nearly doubles its agent coverage. Since `v0.1.7`, the supported agent list grew from 32 to 47, the README got a more readable collapsible agent table, and a few existing agent paths were corrected to match upstream conventions.

### Support for 47 agents

15 new agents were added: `bob`, `continue`, `cortex`, `deepagents`, `firebender`, `github-copilot`, `iflow-cli`, `junie`, `kilo`, `kimi-cli`, `mcpjam`, `pi`, `pochi`, `warp`, and `zencoder`. Each new agent follows the same `defineAgent` pattern with consistent global and project skill directory resolution. The `AgentName` type, agent registry, and test expectations were all updated in lockstep.

### Agent path corrections

- `augment` now uses `.augment/skills/` instead of `.augment/rules/`, aligning with the standard skills directory convention.
- `copilot` now uses `.copilot/` instead of `.github/`, and a new `github-copilot` agent was added pointing to `.copilot/skills/` to match the upstream CLI's actual directory layout.

### Highlights

- Added 15 new agents (bob, continue, cortex, deepagents, firebender, github-copilot, iflow-cli, junie, kilo, kimi-cli, mcpjam, pi, pochi, warp, zencoder).
- Fixed `augment` path from `.augment/rules` to `.augment/skills`.
- Fixed `copilot` path from `.github` to `.copilot` and added `github-copilot` alias.
- Updated README and README.zh-CN with collapsible agent table, removed the "Mode" column, and featured popular agents in the summary.

## v0.1.7

`v0.1.7` is the release where `aweskill` starts feeling more like a maintained toolkit than a loose pile of commands. Since `v0.1.6`, the project got a cleaner resource layout, a more defensible internal foundation, and a much more practical store backup story. The shape of the repo is clearer, the CLI is less fragile, and the workflows around templates, archives, and bundle state finally line up with how people actually use the tool.

### A proper home for shared resources

The repository now has a clearer split between runtime state and in-repo assets. Built-in bundle templates moved into `resources/bundle_templates/`, `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` now lives where contributors expect to find it, and `resources/skill_archives/` was reserved for shareable repository-level archives. That cleanup is small on paper, but it matters: templates, docs, and distributable resources now have stable, documented locations instead of feeling incidental. `aweskill` is easier to package, easier to document, and easier to extend without guessing where things belong.

### Version and filesystem cleanup

`aweskill` now reads its version from `package.json` through a dedicated `AWESKILL_VERSION` module, rather than relying on a string buried in the CLI entrypoint. Along the way, repeated filesystem checks were centralized into `src/lib/fs.ts`, and the codebase picked up a stronger test surface for fs helpers, imports, symlink behavior, command flows, and version consistency. This is mostly invisible when everything works, which is the point. `v0.1.7` reduces duplication, makes the package metadata the source of truth, and gives future changes a better chance of staying correct after build and release.

### Whole-store backup support

The biggest user-facing change in `v0.1.7` is that `aweskill store backup` and `aweskill store restore` now handle more realistic backup workflows. You can pass `--both` to include bundle definitions alongside skills, restore them together, and make sure the automatic pre-restore backup captures the same scope. `store backup` also accepts an optional archive destination, including a target directory that will receive a timestamped archive using the default naming scheme. The README examples were updated to reflect that new flow. In practice, this means backing up `aweskill` is no longer just about preserving `skills/`; it can now preserve the bundle structure that makes those skills usable.

### Highlights

- Moved built-in bundle templates into `resources/bundle_templates/` and documented repo-level archives under `resources/skill_archives/`.
- Centralized `pathExists` and introduced `src/lib/version.ts` so the CLI version comes from `package.json`.
- Added coverage for fs utilities, import behavior, symlink handling, version resolution, and new backup/restore command paths.
- Added `aweskill store backup [archive] [--both]`.
- Added `aweskill store restore <archive> [--override] [--both]`.
- Enabled directory targets for `store backup`, which now emit a default timestamped `skills-*.tar.gz` archive into the chosen folder.
