# Contributing to aweskill

Thank you for being here.

`aweskill` is built around a simple idea: local tooling should reduce mess, not create new mess.
We care about useful features, but we care just as much about preserving a model that stays small,
clear, and reliable over time.

This guide is not only about opening a PR. It is also about how we want to evolve `aweskill`:
with explicit tradeoffs, readable code, and respect for the user's filesystem.

## Project Direction

`aweskill` is not trying to become a giant platform.

The project is intentionally centered on a small set of responsibilities:

- keep one canonical skill store
- define reusable bundles
- project skills into multiple agent runtimes
- provide boring, safe maintenance operations around that workflow

When contributing, please preserve that focus. New features should make the main workflow clearer,
safer, or easier to use. They should not turn the tool into a general package manager, remote registry,
or configuration platform unless there is a very strong reason.

For the stable command model, projection semantics, and other product-level design constraints, see [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md).

## Development Setup

Keep setup simple and reproducible:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wehuman01/aweskill.git
cd aweskill

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Build the CLI
npm run build

# Local CLI usage during development
npm link
aweskill --help
```

## Windows Development Notes

`aweskill` supports Windows as a native platform.

When developing or reviewing Windows-related changes:

- use Node.js 20 or later
- prefer PowerShell for local command examples
- remember that agent projections may be created as junctions on Windows
- if link creation is unavailable, managed copy fallback is acceptable behavior
- backup and restore should not depend on external Unix tools such as `tar`

## Branches

The repository uses two long-lived branches:

- **`main`** — stable line; what users and downstream tooling should treat as the current release.
- **`dev`** — integration branch where day-to-day development happens.

**Workflow:** do most development on **`dev`**. When a feature is implemented and ready to ship, merge **`dev`** into **`main`**. Prefer opening PRs against **`dev`** unless you are told otherwise.

## Engineering Taste

Prefer solutions that are simple, clear, decoupled, honest, focused, and durable.

- Simple: make the smallest change that solves the real problem.
- Clear: optimize for the next reader, not for cleverness.
- Decoupled: keep boundaries clean, but do not add abstractions without a real need.
- Honest: make complexity, state, side effects, assumptions, and failure modes visible; do not hide complexity or create extra complexity.
- Focused: preserve boundaries between `bundle`, `agent`, `store`, and `doctor`, and keep top-level convenience commands minimal.
- Durable: choose behavior that is easy to maintain, test, and extend.
- Reason from first principles: identify the real problem, hard constraints, and known facts before reaching for patterns, abstractions, or prior solutions.

## Code Style

We want the codebase to stay calm and legible.

In practice:

- Runtime language: TypeScript on Node.js 20+
- CLI framework: `commander`
- Tests: `vitest`
- Bundles are plain YAML
- Prefer small, well-bounded functions over large command handlers
- Prefer improving existing command behavior over adding new top-level concepts

## Bundle File Format

Bundles are plain YAML stored under `~/.aweskill/bundles/<name>.yaml`:

```yaml
name: frontend
skills:
  - pr-review
  - frontend-design
```

Keep the format intentionally small. If a proposal adds state that cannot be understood by opening the YAML file directly, that proposal should face a high bar.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Keep the mental model coherent

`aweskill` has a deliberately small command model. Refer to [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) before changing command placement or adding new CLI surface.

If a contribution adds or changes CLI behavior, first ask which of those areas it truly belongs to.
Avoid introducing overlapping commands or synonyms that increase the command surface without adding real capability.

### Protect user state

This tool operates on local directories that users care about.

That means contributions should be conservative about:

- deleting files
- replacing unmanaged directories
- introducing hidden activation state
- automatically rewriting user-owned content without clear boundaries

If a feature changes files, the user should be able to understand what changed and why.

### Prefer explicit over magical

`aweskill` works because its model is inspectable:

- the canonical store is on disk
- bundles are plain YAML
- projected skills are visible in agent directories

Please avoid features that hide core state behind unnecessary abstraction.

## Product Semantics

Detailed product semantics now live in [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md), including:

- command model and top-level convenience commands
- projection model
- import / backup / restore semantics
- find / install / update behavior
- hygiene and display rules
- built-in skill structure

### Projection examples

```bash
# Global projection for one agent
aweskill agent add skill biopython --global --agent codex

# Project-scoped projection for one agent
aweskill agent add skill pr-review --project /path/to/repo --agent cursor

# Bundle expansion writes individual managed projections
aweskill agent add bundle backend --global --agent codex
aweskill agent remove bundle backend --global --agent codex

# Convert linked projections into copied directories
aweskill agent recover --global --agent codex
```

## Documentation

Documentation changes are welcome and important.

If you change:

- command names
- command semantics
- bundle format
- projection behavior
- supported agents
- find/install/update behavior or provider support

please update the relevant docs in the same change:

- `README.md`
- `README.zh-CN.md`
- `docs/DESIGN.md`
- tests that define the CLI surface

## Testing

Before committing or opening a PR, run the full gate:

```bash
npm run verify   # lint (biome + typecheck) → test → build; stops at the first failure
```

CI runs the same steps on pushes to `main` and `dev` and on pull requests to `main`.

If you changed command behavior, add or update command-level tests in `tests/commands.test.ts`.

If you changed low-level behavior, prefer focused tests near the affected modules rather than only relying on broad end-to-end coverage.

### Linting

The project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting, and TypeScript for type checking.

```bash
npm run lint       # check formatting, lint, and type issues
npm run lint:fix   # auto-fix safe issues
npm run typecheck  # run TypeScript type checking only
npm run format     # format all files
```

The CI pipeline runs `npm run lint` before tests. Formatting, lint, and type issues will block merges.

## Releasing

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions.

1. Update the version in `package.json`
2. Add a changelog entry in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with the format `## v<version>`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "chore: prepare release v<version>"`
4. Tag: `git tag v<version>`
5. Push: `git push origin main --tags`

The release workflow will:

- Run tests
- Build the CLI
- Create a GitHub Release with the changelog excerpt
- Publish to npm (requires `NPM_TOKEN` secret in repo settings)

### Required Secrets

- `NPM_TOKEN`: An npm automation token with publish access to the `aweskill` package. Set this in GitHub repo settings under Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.

## Related Projects

`aweskill` references and learns from several adjacent tools:

- [Skills Manager](https://github.com/jiweiyeah/Skills-Manager)

- [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)
- [cc-switch](https://github.com/farion1231/cc-switch)

These projects helped clarify different parts of the design space:

- desktop-first multi-tool management
- CLI-first skill installation and synchronization
- open skill ecosystem conventions
- cross-agent local developer workflow tooling

## Questions

If you are unsure whether a change fits the project, open an issue first or start with a small documentation or test PR.

Focused contributions are preferred over broad rewrites.
