**标题**: AI agents managing their own skills: built a CLI tool for this

**正文**:

Most developer tools still assume "human" is the only operator. You read docs, install CLI, figure out where files go, copy commands from README, paste into terminal, check output, fix paths, then tell your AI coding agent the final state.

In an era where tools only面向 humans, this makes sense.

But current AI coding agents can already run commands, check files, follow project conventions, and fix local state anomalies. If a tool is meant for an agent, the better question isn't:

> How should a human use this CLI?

But:

> Can the agent operate this CLI itself?

That's the design philosophy behind `aweskill` — a CLI-first Skill package manager that AI agents can autonomously operate.

**What it does:**

- Provides a bootstrapping protocol (`README.ai.md`) that tells an agent how to install and initialize itself
- Built-in meta-skills: `aweskill` for management (search, install, update, bundle) and `aweskill-doctor` for repair (sync, clean, dedup, fix)
- Agent projection: map skills to specific agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.) from a central store

**Use cases I've found most useful:**

1. **Fresh agent setup**: Tell a new agent "install aweskill from README.ai.md" — it handles the rest
2. **Skill discovery**: "Find a useful Python data analysis skill" → agent searches, evaluates, installs
3. **Bundle creation**: "Create a frontend bundle with UI design, accessibility, testing skills" → agent assembles and projects
4. **State repair**: `aweskill-doctor` detects broken symlinks, duplicate skills, malformed frontmatter

**Why this matters:**

The right tool for AI agents should be:
- Scriptable via stable CLI
- Conservative on destructive operations
- Checkable before applying changes
- Verifiable after each operation
- Recoverable when local state drifts

`aweskill` is built around this model.

Full disclosure: I built this. It's part of the Webioinfo ecosystem (also includes aweshelf for session bookmarks, awescholar for literature discovery, etc.).

**GitHub**: https://github.com/wehuman01/aweskill
**Agent docs**: https://github.com/wehuman01/aweskill/blob/main/README.ai.md

Curious what others think — is this the right abstraction, or am I solving a problem that'll resolve itself as agents get more capable?

**标题**: Letting AI agents manage their own development tools

**正文**:

I've been thinking about a fundamental mismatch in how we design developer tools for the AI agent era.

Most tools still assume a human is the sole operator. The workflow is: human reads docs → installs → configures → tells agent what happened. The human becomes the package manager.

But agents can already run commands, inspect files, and follow conventions. So if a tool is meant for agents, shouldn't it be designed for agent operation first?

I built `aweskill` around this idea — a CLI-first skill manager where the primary interface is a protocol for agents, not humans.

**The core idea:**

Give agents a bootstrapping document (`README.ai.md`) that tells them:
1. How to install themselves
2. How to set up their skill store
3. How to project skills to the current agent
4. How to verify everything works

After that, you don't memorize commands. You just say:

> "Find a good code review skill, install it, and enable it for this agent."

The agent searches, evaluates, installs, projects, and verifies — all autonomously.

**Two built-in meta-skills:**

- `aweskill` — search, install, update, bundle, agent projection
- `aweskill-doctor` — sync check, cleanup, dedup, repair broken skills

**The principle:**

Tools for AI agents should be:
- Scriptable (stable CLI)
- Conservative on destructive ops
- Checkable before applying
- Verifiable after each step
- Recoverable when state drifts

This is the model `aweskill` follows.

Would love feedback — is this the right level of abstraction, or will agent capabilities make this unnecessary?

**标题**: [Showoff Saturday] aweskill — a skill manager designed for AI agents to operate themselves

**正文**:

Hey r/SideProject!

I built `aweskill` — a CLI-first skill package manager where the primary user is an AI coding agent, not a human.

**The problem I was solving:**

When you use multiple AI coding tools (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, etc.), each has its own skill/plugin directory structure. You end up manually copying files, managing symlinks, and hoping the next agent has a similar layout. You become the package manager.

**The solution:**

`aweskill` gives agents a protocol (`README.ai.md`) they can follow autonomously:

```
Read https://github.com/wehuman01/aweskill/blob/main/README.ai.md
and install aweskill for this agent following the guide.
```

A competent agent can execute this entirely on its own — install, initialize, project skills, verify.

**What agents can do after setup:**

- "Find a useful Python data analysis skill" → searches, evaluates, installs
- "Create a frontend bundle with design, testing, accessibility skills" → assembles and activates
- "Check if my skills need updates" → dry-run check, then applies with approval
- "Fix any broken or duplicate skills" → diagnoses, reports, applies with backup

**Built-in tools:**

- `aweskill` — management (search, install, update, bundle)
- `aweskill-doctor` — repair (sync, clean, dedup, fix)

**Philosophy:**

Tools for AI agents should be:
- Fully scriptable via CLI
- Conservative on destructive operations
- Checkable before changes
- Verifiable after each step
- Recoverable when things break

**Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/wehuman01/aweskill
- Live docs: https://aweskill.wehuman.top/
- Agent guide: https://github.com/wehuman01/aweskill/blob/main/README.ai.md

It's also part of a small ecosystem I'm building (Webioinfo) — includes session bookmarking (aweshelf), literature discovery (awescholar), and more.

**Feedback welcome!** What do you think — is agent-first tool design the right direction, or am I over-engineering something that'll resolve naturally?

### === r/ClaudeCode ===

**标题**: Made a skill manager that Claude Code can operate autonomously

**正文**:

Hey Claude Code community!

I built `aweskill` — a CLI-first skill manager designed so that Claude Code (and other AI coding agents) can manage their own skills without human intervention.

**How it works:**

Give Claude Code this instruction:

```
Read https://github.com/wehuman01/aweskill/blob/main/README.ai.md
and install aweskill for this agent following the guide.
```

Claude Code reads the guide, executes the steps, and sets itself up — installing the CLI, initializing the skill store, projecting skills, and verifying everything works.

**After setup, you can just say:**

> "Find a good test skill and install it."

Claude Code will search, evaluate results, install the best match, project it to itself, and report back what it did.

**Built-in skills:**

- `aweskill` — search, install, update, bundle management
- `aweskill-doctor` — diagnose and repair broken/duplicate skills

**Why this matters for Claude Code users:**

- No manual file copying or directory guessing
- Skills live in a central store, projected to each agent
- Updates propagate automatically — one update, all agents see it
- State repair is automated — `aweskill-doctor` handles broken symlinks, malformed frontmatter, etc.

**Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/wehuman01/aweskill
- Agent-specific guide: https://github.com/wehuman01/aweskill/blob/main/README.ai.md

Full disclosure: I built this. Would love feedback from actual Claude Code users — does this solve a real pain point, or is it something you'd rather handle manually?

### === r/ArtificialIntelligence ===

**标题**: AI agents that manage their own tools: a practical approach

**正文**:

I've been exploring a question: if AI coding agents can already run commands, inspect files, and fix errors, why do we still design tools that require human intervention for setup and maintenance?

I built `aweskill` to test this idea — a skill manager where the primary interface is a protocol for agents, not humans.

**The concept:**

Instead of humans installing and configuring tools for agents, agents install and configure tools for themselves.

The bootstrapping document (`README.ai.md`) tells an agent:
1. Check environment (Node.js, npm)
2. Install the tool
3. Initialize its skill store
4. Identify itself and project skills
5. Verify everything works

**What this enables:**

- **Autonomous discovery**: "Find a useful Python skill" → agent searches and installs
- **Bundle assembly**: "Create a frontend development bundle" → agent assembles relevant skills
- **State maintenance**: `aweskill-doctor` detects and repairs broken configurations
- **Cross-agent portability**: Skills live centrally, projected to any agent on demand

**Design principles:**

Tools for AI agents should be:
- Fully automatable (stable CLI)
- Safe for autonomous operation (conservative on destructive ops)
- Transparent (checkable before applying, verifiable after)
- Recoverable (backup before major changes)

**Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/wehuman01/aweskill
- Agent documentation: https://github.com/wehuman01/aweskill/blob/main/README.ai.md

Would love to hear thoughts — is this the right direction for AI tooling, or will agents eventually handle this without specialized infrastructure?
